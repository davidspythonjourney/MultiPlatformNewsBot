        "text": "U.S. TO RESUME BOMB SHIPMENTS TO ISRAEL\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the United States will soon begin shipping 500-pound bombs to Israel. The Biden administration had previously suspended these shipments in an effort to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza. This two-month pause is now coming to an end, U.S. officials stated.\n\nAn administration official confirmed that the bombs \"are in the process of being shipped\" and are expected to arrive in Israel within the coming weeks. However, the shipment of heavier 2,000-pound bombs remains on hold.\n\n\nJoin ISRAEL REALTIME \ud83c\udf97\ufe0f\"Connecting the World to Israel in Realtime\" \n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 WhatsApp \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://chat.whatsapp.com/DUUPUSUpyVn7WmHyHIIjBE\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 Telegram \ud83d\udc47 \nhttps://t.me/Israel_Realtime_Updates\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 Facebook \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61558471625976\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 X (Twitter) \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://x.com/IsraelRealtime"
